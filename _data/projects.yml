    The tool is meant for injecting arbitrary frames to test the conformance 
    of any WiFi product. The tool has templates for generating various frames 
    which can be customized for generating valid and invalid frames. The tool 
    can be used to elicit responses from other WiFi cards to check the 
    conformance of the card to the protocol.

     WebGuard  is a unique hardware solution to the problem of web page defacing, 
     and it sits between the firewall and the server it is meant to protect. 
     The system is IP transparent and act as invisible content inspection engine. 
     Cryptographic content verification to protect the integrity content. 
     Contents  verified in Real Time, constantly and consistently.

     This project carried out as Bachelor thesis. Implementation of double clipped
     autocorrelation and FFT with burst detection in LabView. This provides a tool
     to simulate and process live stream of data from DAQ. The data acquired is
     used to compare both approaches and give a better idea for further improvement.
