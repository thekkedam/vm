W-Meter is a tool for testing the conformance and evaluating the performance of 802.11 
products. The tool is meant for injecting arbitrary frames to test the 
conformance of any WiFi product. The tool has templates for generating various 
kinds of frames which can be customized for generation of specific frames. The 
tool can be used to elicit responses from other WiFi cards to check the 
conformance of the card to the protocol. At present, 802.11g frames are 
completed.
