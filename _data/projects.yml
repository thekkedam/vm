     This project carried out as Bachelor thesis. Implementation of double clipped
     autocorrelation and FFT with burst detection in LabView. This provides a tool
     to simulate and process live stream of data from DAQ. The data acquired is
     used to compare both approaches and give a better idea for further improvement.
