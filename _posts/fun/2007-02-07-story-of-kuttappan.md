> Theis Kuttappan story is taken from internet.
> It is just a joke about Malayalis. 



He (Kuttappan )is a Malayali working for a multinational company in Mumbai.  Not well educated and he is working as a personal assistant. 

This Kuttappan is having a problem If he hears  somebody talks he will come in between saying that I know that very well I  know him very well like that.  One day Kuttappans Boss a foreign educated person, he  is a north Indian, he was saying something about Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Kuttappan was passing thru that way suddenly he came in between saying that  oh!! Arni !!!!!he s my best friend. 

Kuttapans boss laughed at him saying that how can u be  a friend of Arnold Schwarzenegger you are only a simple person living in  India. Kuttappan said if u won't believe its your problem I  can't help you. 
Ok .. manager said I am going on a trip to the US next  week you come as my assistant and we will go to Arnold's house and see what  happens. 

Kuttappan agreed with a smile. 

A week after they landed in the US first they went to NY  Arnold was there in NY they went to meet Arnold. Seeing Kuttappan Arnold  ran towards Kuttappan and hugged him asking that "hey!!!!!! My master!!!!  Kuttappan!!!!!! long time no see!!!!! where were you, man? I was missing you......." Kuttappan went with Arnold to  have some coffee. Boss was stunned. when Kuttappan came back boss  said.Next we will go to White House lets find out whether you know Bush or not. 

Kuttappan agreed with a smile. 

At Bush's home Bush also did the same as Schwarzenegger  asking that "where were you my friend for long time? My dad will  be so happy to see  you....."; Kuttappan went to have tea with Bush while the boss was sitting outside the gate when Kuttappan came back boss said I have to go to  Vatican get blessings from pope john paul so u come with me. 

At Vatican crowd from all over the world is waiting to  see pope john 
paul.Kuttappan and his boss are also there. Boss asked Kuttappan, do you know pope john paul.  Kuttappan said y not? 

The boss told Kuttappan that he will not believe this. He  told "Arni was okay....Bush ...somewhat okay.... it may happen...but Pop? The Pop? No..NEVER!!!!" 

Kuttappan asked the boss to wait for some time and went  inside the crowd. 

After 15 mints Kuttappan came on the balcony along with  pope john paul. pope john paul was holding Kuttappans hand. 

Kuttappans boss becomes unconscious and fell down. When  Kuttappan came back his boss was on a stretcher by his side nurses  and paramedics. 

Kuttappan asked Sir wat happened.
