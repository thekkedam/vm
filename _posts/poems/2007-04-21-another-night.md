I met her on the street, 
The day was new to me. 
A new way in front of me, 
I forgot the days behind. 

As sunrise in midnight, 
The world went upside down. 

I never felt there is another night, 
The rules of nature never fail. 
The sunset was just to come, 
I prayed to god, 
Please don't take the light again. 

The rules of nature were the same, 
But god blessed me. 
With the light of moon, 
Soft and gentle light.
