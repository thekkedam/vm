<pre>

My promises, will I be able to keep. 
Take my life to be true to you. 

You the one, now for me. 
Don't know is this forever. 

I am sure, I will never change. 
Until I get a new birth. 
I believe, This is in my soul. 
So this love in all my birth. 

That's why, I love you. 
To get another birth, 
to love you again.
