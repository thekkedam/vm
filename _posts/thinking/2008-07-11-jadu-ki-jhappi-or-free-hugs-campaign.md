We know about "jadu ki jhappi" [in Munna Bhai MBBS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munna_Bhai_M.B.B.S.), it was just in a movie. Now it is taken seriously by people. This is called as "Free Hugs Campaign". I relay don't know whether he did watch "Munna Bhai MBBS" movie and got inspired. It's very nice to hug, i think it have a psychological effect which can give us peace of mind. 

So we all can join in this campaign ...
