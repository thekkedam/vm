India Against Corruption, Chennai chapter took a short film. The motive of 
this is to show how a small amount of corruption piles up to big. This video 
does not intent to show a solution neither the full picture of the problem. 
This is just a view of a subset of the  big issue in current India. We like to 
ask all viewers, do you like to see some difference or not ? 

I was lucky enough to contribute in this :)
