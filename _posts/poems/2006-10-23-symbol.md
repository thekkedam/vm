<pre>

A long silence, 
Few drops of tears, 
Collection of words, 
Dream of you, for a life together, 
That's me with few letters of a name. 

Sorrow doesn't end with these words, 
Dream of you became time. 

Does there is a word, I can spell for you, 
I never found. 

I didn't know my name mean everything, 
As a symbol.
